# Smart-mirror
A smart mirror is an interactive, reflective display that shows useful information like time, weather, calendar, and notifications while functioning as a regular mirror.


This smart mirror combines a one-way mirror with a custom display and interactive lighting to provide a seamless, modern user experience. When the ultrasonic sensor detects nearby motion, an LED light strip controlled by a relay illuminates the mirror, and the display activates, showing a personalized message, current date, and time. Key components include an LED screen with an I2C module for efficient data display and an ultrasonic sensor for motion-based activation, making it both functional and visually appealing. Perfect for adding a touch of smart tech to any space!
